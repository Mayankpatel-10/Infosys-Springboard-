1. Software:
Software is a set of instructions/programs that tell a computer how to perform tasks.
It is intangible (cannot be touched).
Types of Software:
System Software: OS (Windows, Linux), Device Drivers, Utilities.
Application Software: Word, Browsers, Games, WhatsApp.
Programming Software: Compilers, Interpreters, IDEs.

2. Applications of Python:
Web Development
Data Science
AI & Machine Learning
Automation/Scripting
Game Development
Desktop Applications
Cybersecurity
Scientific Computing
IoT
Blockchain & FinTech

3. Variables:
A variable is a name used to store data in memory.
In Python, everything is stored as an object.
Not key-value (only dictionaries use key-value pairs).

4. Value:

The actual data stored in a variable.

5. Datatype:
Defines the type of value a variable can hold.
Examples: int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set.

6. String:
A sequence of characters enclosed in ' ' or " ".
Example: "Hello", 'Python'.

7. Declaration & Initialization:
Declaration: Creating a variable name.
Initialization: Assigning a value to it.
Example: x = 10.

8. Frontend, Backend, Database:
Frontend: User interface (UI).
Backend: Server-side logic.
Database: Stores and manages data.

9. Type Conversion:
Changing a value from one datatype to another.

10. Type Casting:
Explicit conversion using functions like:
int(), float(), str(), list().

11. Symbols:
Remainder: %
Quotient: //

12. Logical Operators:
and: True if both are true.
or: True if at least one is true.
not: Reverses the condition.

13. if: single condition
Used when you need to check only one condition.
If the condition is True → execute code.
If False nothing happens.

2. if-else: two conditions (True/False)
Used when you want either this or that.
If condition is True runs if block.
If condition is False runs else block.

3. if-elif-else: multiple conditions
Used when there are many possible conditions.
Python checks conditions one by one from top to bottom.
Only the first True condition’s block is executed.
If none are True else block runs.

4. Nested if: if inside another if
Used when you need to check a condition within another condition.
The second if runs only if the first one is True.
