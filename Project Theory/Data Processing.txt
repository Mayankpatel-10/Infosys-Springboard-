Data processing is the systematic process of collecting, organizing, and transforming raw data into meaningful, accurate, and useful information.


Raw data by itself is not valuable, but when processed, it becomes information that supports decision-making, analysis, and predictions.

Steps in Data Processing
Data Collection
Raw data is gathered from multiple sources.
Sources: databases, sensors, surveys, online forms, APIs, IoT devices, etc.
Example: Collecting air quality readings from monitoring stations.

Data Preparation (Preprocessing)
Raw data usually contains noise, errors, or missing values.
In this step, data is cleaned and formatted.
Tasks:
Handldng missing values
Removing duplicates
Correcting wrong entries
Normalizing or scaling values

Data Input
The cleaned data is entered into the system (databases, ML models, analytics software).
Example: Feeding student marks into an analysis program.

Data Processing
Algorithms, statistical models, or machine learning methods are applied.
This is where transformation, computations, and analysis happen.
Example: Calculating average, applying filters, running predictive models.

Data Storage
Processed data is stored securely in databases, warehouses, or cloud systems.
Ensures future access and use.
Data Output
Results are presented in a human-readable format.
Examples: reports, dashboards, graphs, summaries.

Data Interpretation
The final stage where processed information is analyzed for insights and decision-making.
Example: Concluding that pollution levels are rising in a city based on processed air quality data.
