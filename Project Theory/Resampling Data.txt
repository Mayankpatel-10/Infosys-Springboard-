Resampling Data in Air Quality Prediction System

When you collect air quality data, it usually comes in timestamps (like every second or every minute). To make analysis and prediction easier, you need to resample the data into a consistent frequency, such as daily averages or hourly averages.

Load Data
First, bring your dataset (CSV, API, or database) into a DataFrame with a date-time column.

Convert Date Column
Ensure the date column is recognized as a datetime type so that time-based operations can be done.

Set Datetime as Index
Make the datetime column the index of the DataFrame. This allows you to use resampling functions easily.

Resample Daily
Group the data by day to calculate daily averages, maximums, or sums of pollutants.

Example: Find average PM2.5 and PM10 per day.

Resample Hourly
Group the data by hour to capture variations within the day.

Example: Find average AQI every hour.

Fill Missing Values
Sometimes, data might be missing in a particular hour or day. Handle it using forward fill, backward fill, or interpolation.

Use for Forecasting
Once resampled, the clean dataset (daily or hourly) is ready to be used in EDA, trend analysis, and machine learning models for air quality prediction.
